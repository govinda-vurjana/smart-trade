# SmartTrade: Advanced Reinforcement Learning Platform for Algorithmic Trading

## Overview
SmartTrade is a comprehensive, modular system for developing, training, and evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) agents in algorithmic trading environments. It supports both live and historical data, enabling rapid experimentation and robust deployment of RL strategies in real-world financial markets.

## System Architecture
### RL Agents
- **Custom Implementations:** Agents built from scratch using PyTorch, including PPO, DQN, SPPO, Double DQN, and actor-critic architectures.
- **Stable-Baselines3 Integration:** Support for industry-standard RL libraries for rapid prototyping and benchmarking.
- **Sequence Modeling:** LSTM layers for time-series data, enabling agents to learn temporal dependencies and market patterns.
- **Action Spaces:** Discrete (buy/sell/hold) and continuous (position sizing, risk adjustment).

### Environments
- **Custom Trading Environments:** Step/reset logic, feature engineering, and reward shaping tailored for financial tasks.
- **State Representation:** Multi-dimensional tensors built from engineered market features (OHLCV, technical indicators, trend signals).
- **Reward Engineering:** Sparse and dense reward functions for profit, risk management, and prediction accuracy.
- **Live Data Integration:** Real-time data feeds and proprietary execution interfaces for production deployment.

### Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering
- **Raw Data Sources:** The platform supports ingestion of both live market feeds and large historical datasets (CSV, PT formats). Data includes OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) and other market indicators.
- **Preprocessing:** Data is cleaned, normalized, and resampled to multiple timeframes (e.g., 1min, 5min, daily) to support diverse RL tasks and agent robustness.
- **Feature Engineering:** Custom scripts extract technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, MACD, volatility measures), trend signals, and engineered features for state representation. Feature sets are tailored for each environment and agent type.
- **Data Storage:** Preprocessed and feature-engineered datasets are stored in the `Preprocessed/` folder for reproducibility and efficient training.
- **Data Handling for Large Files:** For very large datasets, Git LFS or external storage solutions are recommended. The README documents which files may require special handling due to size constraints.

### Evaluation & Logging
- **Automated Evaluation:** Scripts for benchmarking agent performance (profit, risk-adjusted returns, prediction accuracy).
- **Model Checkpointing:** Systematic saving/loading of model states for reproducibility and analysis.
- **Experiment Logging:** Detailed logs of training, evaluation, and live trading sessions.

### Integration & Deployment
- **External System Interface:** Automated execution via APIs and UI automation (e.g., pyautogui for trading platforms).
- **Asynchronous Feedback:** Real-time audio and system feedback for live operation.
- **Production-Ready:** Designed for deployment in real trading environments with robust error handling and monitoring.

## Reinforcement Learning Details
- **Algorithms:** PPO, DQN, SPPO, Double DQN, actor-critic, experience replay, target networks, curriculum learning.
- **State Space:** Multi-dimensional tensors of engineered features, technical indicators, and time-series data for LSTM-based agents.
- **Action Space:** Discrete (buy/sell/hold) and continuous (position sizing, risk adjustment), supporting a range of trading strategies and risk profiles.
- **Reward Functions:** Custom rewards for profit, risk management, prediction accuracy, trading costs, and behavioral incentives (e.g., penalizing overtrading).
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Trading performance: Net profit, win rate, average trade return
  - Risk-adjusted returns: Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, maximum drawdown
  - Prediction accuracy: Directional accuracy, confusion matrix, F1 score
  - Robustness: Performance under market regime changes, noise sensitivity
  - Sample efficiency: Learning curve analysis, convergence speed
  - Generalization: Out-of-sample and cross-market evaluation

## Evaluation Process
- **Backtesting:** Agents are evaluated on historical data to benchmark performance, generalization, and risk management. Multiple market scenarios and timeframes are used for robust assessment.
- **Live Testing:** Agents interact with live data feeds and external trading systems for real-world validation, including automated trade execution and monitoring.
- **Logging & Checkpointing:** All experiments are logged, and models are checkpointed for reproducibility, rollback, and further analysis.
- **Automated Reporting:** Performance metrics, trading logs, and evaluation reports are generated for each experiment, including visualizations of learning curves, trade distributions, and risk profiles.
- **Advanced Metrics:** Reports include risk-adjusted returns, drawdown analysis, confusion matrices, and out-of-sample generalization results.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` in the relevant agent folders.
3. Run training scripts in the RL agent folders to start experiments.
4. Use evaluation scripts to benchmark agent performance and generate reports.
